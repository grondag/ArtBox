# Introduction
ArtBox houses textures and other resources used by other Grondag mods.  They don't change frequently and take up a lot of space. Packaging them separately allows reuse and avoid wasted bandwith when dependent mods are updated.

# Mod Packs and Support
This mod is in active development and is not feature-complete nor stable.  You MAY use this mod in ModPacks but be aware that future releases may require a world reset. It is therefore not recommended for servers or worlds you intend to keep for a long time.

This mod is [licensed under the MIT license](https://github.com/grondag/Hard-Science/blob/master/LICENSE). This means no warranty is provided.
